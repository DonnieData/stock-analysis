# Stock Data Analysis / VBA Code Refactoring  


## Project Overview / Challenge  
Refactoring of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code used to analyze given stock data by year to improve performance while mainiting original finctionality. 

## results 

Steps taken to refactor the VBA include: 
- combining sub statements into one script 
- utilizing additional arrays to store values to decrease the ammount of declared variables initializing 
- restructuring for loops iterate through loops and output data

Refactoring lead to cleaner and more organized code as well as improved performance when running. 
Due to increased performance the VBA script runs noticably faster than before refarctoring:

## Summary  

While refarctoring code to increase functionalitly is always a great idea, its importatn to make note of the cons as well as the pros. 

For example the clear pros of refactoring would be: 
 - better organized code 
 - code better suits the task at hand 
 - code is optimized and runs better 

However refactioring also entails these cons:
-cons 
- the time it takes to refactor the code may not yield signiifanct enough results 
- can introduce errors to code in the process to something that already works 

When considering refactoring code, which at its root is simply making the code more efficient without adding new funcitonailty.
It is improtant to consider if it is the right choice for you.
