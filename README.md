# Stock Data Analysis / VBA Code Refactoring  


## Project Overview / Challenge  
Refactoring of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code used to analyze given stock data by year to improve performance while maintaining original functionality. 

## results 

Steps taken to refactor the VBA include: 
- combining sub statements into one script 
- utilizing additional arrays to store values to decrease the amount of declared variables initializing 
- restructuring for loops iterate through loops and output data

Refactoring lead to cleaner and more organized code as well as improved performance when running. 
Due to increased performance the VBA script runs noticeably faster than before refactoring:

## Summary  

While refactoring code to increase functionality is always a great idea, its important to make note of the cons as well as the pros. 

For example, the clear pros of refactoring would be: 
 - better organized code 
 - code better suits the task at hand 
 - code is optimized and runs better 

However, refactoring also entails these cons:
-cons 
- the time it takes to refactor the code may not yield significant enough results 
- can introduce errors to code in the process to something that already works 

When considering refactoring code, which at its root is simply making the code more efficient without adding new functionality.
It is important to consider if it is the right choice for you.
