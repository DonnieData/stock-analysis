# Stock Data Analysis / VBA Code Refactoring  


## Project Overview / Challenge  
Refactoring of Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code used to analyze given stock data by year to improve performance while mainiting original finctionality. 

## results 

Steps taken to refactor the VBA include: 
- combining sub statements into one script 
- utilizing additional arrays to store values to decrease the ammount of declared variables initializing 
- restructuring for loops iterate through loops and output data

Refactoring lead to cleaner and more organized code as well as improved performance when running. 
Due to increased performance the VBA script runs noticably faster than before refarctoring:

## Summary  

While refarctoring code to increase functionalitly is always a great idea, its importatn to make note of the cons as well as the pros. 
For example the clear pros of refactoring would be: 
 - better organized code 
 - code better suits the task at hand 
 - code is optimized and runs better 

However refactioring also entails these cons:
-cons 
time it takes to redo code with the exat same funcitonality 
- may make it to specified for certain criteria.
- can introduce errors to code in the process to something that already works 

How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?n the advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script (3 pt).
